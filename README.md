# Password Generator challenge

A website has been created for a Password Generator.

When you click on "Generate Password" a prompt will ask "length of password"

After you answer "length of pw", it will ask if you'd like an uppercase,
if you'd like a lowercase, numbers and special characters.

if you chose none, you will be given an alert saying you must choose one.

If you choose a number below 8 or above 128, it alert that chosen number must be between 8-128.

If you chose a letter, it will alert you that is NaN.

Once you've chosen all of the requirements it will then generate a randomized password.
