# Password Generator challenge

A reset css is in the Assets folder.

Extensive customized Style.css has been made.

I have created a monocromatic webpage with some basic information about myself.

My first deployment link is attached within the first and large image in the "work" section.

all 5 boxes light up when they are hovered.

When an item listed in the Header is clicked, it will lead you to the specific section identified, except for the "Resume" section.

When you approach the footer of the page, you will see contact information, such as contact (not a real number, yet), my github link and the LinkedIn.
